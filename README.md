YOLOv5-WAL is a YOLOv5-based deep learning supervised approach to automate the detection of fluids emitted from cold seeps (gaseous methane) and volcanic sites (liquid carbon dioxide). Several thousand annotated echograms collected from different seas and oceans during distinct surveys were used to train and test the deep learning model. The tests were conducted on a dataset comprising hundreds of thousands of echograms i) acquired with three different multibeam echosounders (Kongsberg EM302 and EM122 and Reson Seabat 7150) and ii) characterized by variable water column noise conditions related to sounder artefacts and the presence of biomass (fishes, dolphins). 


This repository contains the code for inference with YOLOv5 and models trained for fluid emission detection on various Multibeam Echosounders (EM122, EM302, Reson Seabat 7150). This fluid detector was already used for near-real time acquisition detection during the cruises  [MAYOBS23 (EM122 - 2022)]([URL](https://campagnes.flotteoceanographique.fr/campaign?id=18002494)) and  [HAITI-TWIST (Seabat Reson 7150 - 2024)]([URL](https://campagnes.flotteoceanographique.fr/campagnes/18001258)).

Weights of the neural networks are available on the following doi:

## How to install YOLOv5-WAL

Here is how to install the environment. 

```
git clone https://github.com/perrettymea/YOLO-WAL-fluid-detection-WCI-data
cd requirements
conda env create -f YOLOV5WAL.yml
conda activate YOLOV5WAL
```

## How to perform an inference on multi-beam data with GLOBE ![Ic√¥ne](IMG/LOGO/IconeGlobe24.png)

First, MBES data are acquired in raw format (e.g, .all/.wcd, .kmall, .s7k datagrams). For inference with YOLOv5-WAL it is necessary to convert them to a Cartesian representation for each ping. This can be done using the GLOBE software. GLOBE (GLobal Oceanographic Bathymetry Explorer) is an innovative application for processing and displaying oceanographic data. GLOBE provides processing and display solutions for multi-sensor data (such as water column MBES data). GLOBE can be downloaded [here](https://www.seanoe.org/data/00592/70460/) for Linux and Windows.

### Manual method


Converting the raw file into a g3D file:

* Load your raw file by clicking on: Data :arrow_forward: Import :arrow_forward:Load data file

* Convert your raw file in XSF (following the SONAR-netcf4 convention for sonar data).
<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="IMG\SCREENSHOTS\2024-11-29 13_55_45-Globe.png" alt="export_xsf" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

Select **xsf** output format and where you want to save this new file. 


* This file is not already in cartesian representation so we to need to convert it in G3D netcdf format (WC Polar Echograms).

<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="IMG\SCREENSHOTS\2024-11-29 13_56_44-Globe.png" alt="export_g3D" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

It is possible to configure:
* Parameters for interpolation (from polar to cartesian representation)
* Filtering for dB value, bottom detection, sidelobe, beam index, depth or across distance.
* Subsampling
* Layers you want to export: backscatter (mean, max). We do not advise to consider *bacscatter_comp* layers for this detection case.
  
:heavy_check_mark: This G3D contains the following informations that you can access:


```
Groups:
  Group: [Ping number]

  Variables:
        elevation: ('vector', 'position') float32
          Attributes:
            units: meters
            long_name: elevation
            standard_name: elevation
        longitude: ('vector', 'position') float64
          Attributes:
            units: degrees_east
            long_name: longitude
            standard_name: longitude
        latitude: ('vector', 'position') float64
          Attributes:
            units: degrees_north
            long_name: latitude
            standard_name: latitude
        backscatter_mean: ('height', 'length') float32
          Attributes:
            units: dB
            long_name: backscatter_mean
            standard_name: backscatter_mean
```

This manual method must be used for all raw files before inference. 


:arrow_forward:If you have other software/code that can extract pings from the water column and represent it as a 2D-cartesian-matrix format (numpy, as with g3D), you can direct it to the neural network for inference. As neural networks were not trained on our specific format, be careful to fit with g3D outputs.

### Bonus: Water column visualization

GLOBE can also help you to visualize your water column 2D data by selecting the **xsf** file :arrow_forward: Open with :arrow_forward: Water Column 2D viewer. This tool will allows you to visualize Water Column Images ping per ping.

## Inference with YOLOv5-WAL example

Python code for inference can be run using the following line:

```
python inference_on_G3D.py  --name_acquisition DEMO --confidence_threshold 0.3 --name_model GHASS2_Reson_Seabat.pt --dB_min 20 --dB_max 70
```

### Parameters to be set for the inference


* *G3D*: Path to the folder containing G3D files for inference (default: 'G3D')
* *results*: Path to save inference results (default: 'RESULTS')
* *folder_model*: Path to the folder containing model weights (default: 'NETWORKS')
* *name_acquisition*: Name of the inference experiment (default: 'TEST_INFERENCE')
* *name_model*: Name of the model file to use, including .pt extension (default: 'training_test_with_G3D.pt')
* *confidence_threshold*: Threshold for discriminating detections (default: 0.3)
* *size_img*: Size to resize images before inference, has to be a multiple of 32 as detailed in YOLOv5 documentation (will be resized if not) (default: 960)
* *dB_min*: Minimum dB value for data normalization (default: -50)
* *dB_max*: Maximum dB value for data normalization (default: 10)

dB_min/dB_max allow to normalize data for inference. Values below dB_min an above dB_max will be clipped to this value. You have to fix these limits in order to see properly your fluid echoes, used for example the limits of the colorbar you used. In the event that the dB_min/dB_max values are not adequately defined, the resulting inference will be of poor quality. This is due to the fact that the discrepancy between the features of the training and inference data will be too significant. You have to fix these limits in order to see properly your fluid echoes.

### Results

<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="IMG\SCREENSHOTS\terminal.JPG" alt="terminal" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

(Here *db_min* and *dB_max* are very high, du to a Reson Seabat 7150 specificity). Folders are created, one with the images on which the detections are made and one with the coordinates of the detections, sorted by the original G3D file.

<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="IMG\SCREENSHOTS\example_detection.png" alt="detection" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>


The coordinates of the detections can be used for visualisation in a Geographic Information System and correspond to the mid-point of the detection box. 
The following parameters were recorded for each detection:

| **Parameter**                     | **Description**                                          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Longitude (WGS84)**             | Longitude of the detected object (center of the box).                       |
| **Latitude (WGS84)**                      | Latitude of the detected object (center of the box).                        |
| **Average Depth**               | Average depth calculated as \((h_{\text{min box}} + h_{\text{max box}}) / 2\). |
| **File Name**                    | Name of the file where the detection occurred.         |
| **Ping**                         | The specific ping number associated with the detection. |
| **Box Coordinates**              | Coordinates of the bounding box in the image (in pixels).          |
| **Confidence Index**             | Confidence score of the detection from the model.      |
